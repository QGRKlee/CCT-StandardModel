TITLE: Cyclic Group Actions on Division-Algebra Lattices: Deriving the Standard Model from Spin(8) to Spin(3)

ABSTRACT
We derive the Standard Model gauge group SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) from cyclic group actions on the integer lattices of the four normed division algebras (Z, Eisenstein, Hurwitz, Cayley). Root systems A1 subset A2 subset D4 subset E8 are generated and acted upon by discrete spinors (rotors in Cl(8)). We define Cycle Clocks as finite sequences of cyclic actions (orders 2, 3, 4, 5) that organize the inter-division-algebraic structure into bipartitions 4+4, 6+6, and 5+5. A semi-conformal 8-to-3 projection (Spin(8) to Spin(3)) to the Fibonacci Icosagrid preserves the discrete angle spectra: {60, 90, 120, 180} deg for D4/E8/FIG 4G frames and {60, 120} deg for A2. We compute stabilizers of the order-3, order-4, and order-5 operators: Stab(C4) = U(4) (dimension 16), Stab(C3) and Stab(C5) (dimension 8, su(3)-type), and an su(2) intersection. Hence Spin(8) contains U(4) which contains SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1). All claims are supported by lemmas/theorems with machine-checked enumerations and stabilizer dimensions.

MOTIVATION
Discrete ontologies achieve realistic physics in multiple frameworks. Causal Dynamical Triangulations and Loop Quantum Gravity use discrete elements to recover continuum behavior. t Hooft, Wolfram, and Fredkin motivate digital/computational views; Deutsch argues reality is quantum computation. Lattice QCD uniquely predicts hadron spectra from first principles. Cycle Clock Theory (CCT) treats spinors as algorithms on algebraic boards under a principle of computational least action. Adams' Hopf invariant one theorem singles out dimensions 1, 2, 4, 8 for normed division algebras; their integer lattices underlie maximal sphere packings used in error correction and optimization. These facts motivate a discrete, computationally economical path to gauge structure from first principles.
