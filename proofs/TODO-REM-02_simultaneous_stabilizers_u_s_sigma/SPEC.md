# TODO-REM-02: Simultaneous stabilizers Stab(u) ∩ Stab(sigma) ∩ Stab(s)

Goal: linear-constraint solve for X in so(8) with [X,u]=[X,sigma]=[X,s]=0. Report dimension, basis, and Lie brackets. Outputs: triple-intersection.log, basis.npy. Acceptance: dimension stable under random basis changes; brackets close and match claimed algebra.
