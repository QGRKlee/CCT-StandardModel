# TODO-REM-04: Russian-doll hulls from the true FIG pipeline

Goal: from the *true* FIG model set (not scaffold), produce convex hulls and strict half-space inclusion for cuboctahedron ⊃ octahedron ⊃ octahedron after circumsphere normalization = 1. Outputs: hull-planes.json, inclusion-margins.txt. Acceptance: min margin > 0 for both inner layers.
