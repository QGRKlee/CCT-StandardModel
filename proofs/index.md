# Certification Index

Status legend: [READY] = certificate present or trivially reproducible; [TODO] = remaining certification to be coded.

## READY (12)

- CERT-01 — Units enumeration yields A1, A2, D4, E8 with counts 2, 6, 24, 240 [READY]
- CERT-02 — E8 decomposes into ten disjoint D4 shells (24-cells) [READY]
- CERT-03 — Order-5 pointer s acts by two 5-cycles on the ten shells [READY]
- CERT-04 — Order-4 clicker sigma has sigma^2 = -I; Stab(sigma) is U(4), dim 16 [READY]
- CERT-05 — Order-2 swap t stabilizer is Spin(4) x Spin(4) ~= SU(2)^4 [READY]
- CERT-06 — Intersection Stab(s) ∩ Stab(sigma) is su(2), dim 3 [READY]
- CERT-07 — Allowed angle spectra: E8/Hurwitz: {60, 90, 120, 180}; Eisenstein: {60, 120} [READY]
- CERT-08 — FIG 4G frames carry the same angle set {60, 90, 120, 180} [READY]
- CERT-09 — Semi-conformal 8->3 projection is equivariant for the clock actions on labels [READY]
- CERT-10 — Spin(3) image supports Pauli modules and Pauli-to-Dirac pairing [READY]
- CERT-11 — Primitive order-2 sub-clock: Z on S^0 -> Eisenstein on S^1 [READY]
- CERT-12 — Inclusion chain: SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) ⊂ U(4) ⊂ Spin(8) [READY]

## REMAINING TO CODE (5)

- TODO-REM-01 — Order-3 operator u: explicit matrices; centralizer dim 8 (su(3)-type); orbit logs [TODO]
- TODO-REM-02 — Simultaneous stabilizers: Stab(u) ∩ Stab(sigma) ∩ Stab(s): dimension and structure [TODO]
- TODO-REM-03 — Equivariant projection certificate: numeric invariants under 8->3 map (hashes, angle-preservation tables) [TODO]
- TODO-REM-04 — Russian-doll hulls derived from the true FIG pipeline (not the scaffold): strict half-space certificates [TODO]
- TODO-REM-05 — Hypercharge rational quantization from order-5 phases: table matching Q = T3 + Y/2 [TODO]

**Note.** Each READY item has a subfolder with a short README and a slot for machine logs. Each TODO item has a SPEC.md that defines acceptance criteria and outputs to archive when completed.
